# TODO:
Small things:
    Add dropout.
    Add optimiser (momentum, RMSprop, adam)
    Worst classifications in visualize mnist (with logits)
    Make own train_test_split function
    Fix importing from parent folder (data_loaders and data_visualizer)

Large implementations:
    Evolutionary Algorithms
    Unsupervised learning stuff
    Layerwise Neural Networks
    CNN layers

Maybe:
    Netwons method for Multinomial logistic regression
