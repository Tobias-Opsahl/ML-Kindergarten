# TODO:
Small things:
    Worst classifications in visualize mnist (with logits)
    NN stuff
    Make own train_test_split function
    Fix importing from parent folder (data_loaders and data_visualizer)

Large implementations:
    Nerual Networks
    Evolutionary Algorithms
    Unsupervised learning stuff

Maybe:
    Netwons method for Multinomial logistic regression
    More interesting examples in the run notebooks
