# Models for Machine Learning and AI

This is a project where I implement various models and function from statistics, machine-learning and AI. They are implemented "from scratch" with numpy. They are intended to be moderately generic, but of course have lower performance than well-known libraries. The intention of the project is to learn by implementing from scratch.

The intention is to add Linear Models, Neural Networks, Evolutionary Algorithms and maybe more.
